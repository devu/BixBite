		//TODO consider root of virtual display list to be pass directly to the context rather trught BixBite.
		
		/*
		BixBite framework exposes very few Classes/Components on the global scope ready to work with and extend your own classes from.
		It is very shallow and strict structure, deal with it as a set of reserved words. From v0.9.5 we have additional tools to laverage cross-platform compatibility on display level.
		
		instances:
		DisplayList - virtual display list as a root of your application grphical context.
		BixBite 	- main Class, in order to initialise framework you need to create one instance of this Class.
		
		abstract classes:
		Context		- every graphical context is wrapped up into this class to gain access to context.gl API
		Behaviour	- executable component with an extra method execute() to leverage business logic;
		Compound	- functional module
		Data		- data component
		Transponder	- transponder component
		View		- view component
		
		There are also some helper methods available on the global scope:
		
		trace();
		getTimer();
		
		From now on all classes you are going to write should extend those components above and have one method implemented within, init();
		For instance:
		
		MyCompound.extend(Compound);
		function MyCompound(){
			this.init=function(){
				trace(MyCompound has been initialised);
			}
		}
		
		It is recomended that Behaviour,Data,Transponder and View class definitions are writen inside Compound body to prevent exposing them into global scope.
		
		For instance:
		MyCompound.extend(Compound);
		function MyCompound(){
			this.init=function(){
				trace(MyCompound has been initialised);
				this.register(MyView);
			}
			
			MyView.extend(View);
			function MyView(){
				this.init=function(){
					trace(MyView is up);
				}
			}
		}
		
		In BixBite framework you don't have to worry about JS scope issues.
		if you adding slots and recieving signals or dealing with native events 'this' always refers to the Class you are in.
		
		For instance:
		
		MyView.extend(View);
		function MyView(){
			this.init=function(){
				this.addSlot("test", onTest);
			}
			
			onTest = function(signal){
				trace(this);//output MyView
			}
		}
		*/
		
		// Here is some example Compound(Functional Module) definition with internal Components
		// In this example we testing View with an Context
		MyCompound.extend(Compound);
		function MyCompound(){
			
			this.init=function(){
				//register your view within Compound
				this.register(MyView);
			}
			
			MyView.extend(View);
			function MyView(){
				
				this.init=function(){
					//get already registered context as a container
					var root = this.getContext("main");
					//if you want your context to be available for the other views/transponders register it:
					var ctx = this.registerContext("test", new MyContext());
					//otherwise you can simply do this:
					//var ctx = new MyContext();
					root.addChild(ctx);
					
				}
			}
		}
		
		//now define what your custom context should do
		MyContext.extend(Context);
		function MyContext(){
			
			//This is important to remember than Context is the only part of the system that you constructing your object ahead.
			//that's why you need to call super();
			Context.call(this);
			
			this.init=function(){
				gl.setMode(GL.DOM);
				gl.beginFill(0xFF0000,1);
				gl.drawRect(0,0,100,100);
			}
		}
		
		var t = getTimer();
		//let's create instance of our virtual display list and pass the native anchor of display root
		//in case of HTML its a document.body, but can be any div
		var root = new MultiDisplayList(document.body);
		
		//This is a typical code block to initialise BixBite:
		//Create Instance of BixBite
		var bb = new BixBite(root);
		//add some context into display list, so you can access it from the view
		bb.addContext("main", new Context());
		//Spawn a core(You can spawn multiple cores and register diferent Compounds within them)
		var core = bb.spawnCore("main");
		//Register our previusly created Compound
		core.register(MyCompound);
		//Compound can start itself if you have some auto executable Behaviours or you can always kick start them with some custom signal
		core.emitSignal("kick");
		//It is usefull if you need to pass some initial parameters to your functional Module/Compound
		//core.emitSignal("kick", {delay:100});
		
		//let's see how much it took
		trace("time:", getTimer()-t);
