     * <p>The Compound represents a container you can build your functional module within. You can register as many Components as you need to achive your goal. 
	 * As well add Behaviours into it to controll a business logic of the module. However it is strongly recomented to keep them as compact and clear as possible. 
	 * If 1 Compound performs multiple unrelated functions, consider refactoring it into set of smaller Compounds registered toogether.</p>
     *
     * <p>In case you have more than one instance of this Compound running on the same Core at the same time, system will use currently running to preserve resources.
     * This is very useful in modular projects. You don't have to worry aboud dependencies or duplicates. 
	 * By registering the same Compound within anothers you act more like what other set of Compounds is required to run your newly created one.</p>
