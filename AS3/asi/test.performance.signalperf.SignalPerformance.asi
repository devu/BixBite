	 *
	 * @version  compatibility - 0.4.5
	 * @since 0.4.2
	 *   footprint 8.92kb
	 *   
	 *     Subject of this test is to check performance of the current MVC specific signal flow implementation.
	 *   It is protected on the core level witch actor can talk to witch one. 
	 *   Also checking entire triad communication not just signal broadcasting removed from the context.
	 *   
	 *     1 Phase
	 *   On mouse click Controller will send signal to Model and Model respond to View.
	 *   This is just test a flow test. Making sure View and Model can get response from Controller in controller manier.
	 *   
	 *     2 Phase
	 *   Once 1 Phase is finished View will send X number of times signals going through full triade following the flow:
	 *   View -> Controller -> Model -> View. When finish will send signal to Stats to display results.
	 *   
	 *     Results (Flash Player 11,1,102,63 - Chrome)
	 *   Signals traveling from View -> Controller -> Model -> View.
	 *   
	 *     v0.4.2
	 *   1.000 		- 2ms		(3k signals in circulation)
	 *   10.000 		- 22ms		(30k signals in circulation)
	 *   100.000		- 207ms		(300k signals in circulation)
	 *   1.000.000	- 2120ms	(3M signals in circulation)
	 *   
	 *     v0.4.3
	 *   1.000 		- 1ms		(3k signals in circulation)
	 *   10.000 		- 13ms		(30k signals in circulation)
	 *   100.000		- 133ms		(300k signals in circulation)
	 *   1.000.000	- 1325ms	(3M signals in circulation)
	 *   
	 *     v0.4.4 
	 *   No changes to compare to v0.4.3
	 *   
	 *     v0.4.4 and signal reference system in use!
	 *   1.000 		- no time:)	(3k signals in circulation)
	 *   10.000 		- 1ms		(30k signals in circulation)
	 *   100.000		- 9ms		(300k signals in circulation)
	 *   1.000.000	- 99ms		(3M signals in circulation)
	 *   10.000.000	- 931ms		(30M signals in circulation) and this is what we talking about :).
