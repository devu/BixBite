	 * The Behavior is an anthropomorphic construct that assigns "life" to the activities carried out by Atom in response to stimuli, such as user input (Transponder). 
	 * Also, "a behavior" is a reusable block of code that, when applied to an object, especially a graphical one, causes it to respond to user input in meaningful patterns or to operate independently.
	 * In BixBite Behaviours can broadcast signals only to Views in Multi-cast and Signle-Cast mode. 
	 * Because entire business logic is realised by set of Behaviours they can also request Data components. 
	 * They are part of Atom build in to Compond and the only bridge between application Data and View components.
